# AI API Integrator — Delivery Plan

## 0) Vision
Turn raw API docs (OpenAPI/Postman/GraphQL/AsyncAPI or prose) into production-ready integration code, workflow automations, tests, and monitors—scaffolded with best practices and full observability.

## 1) Success Outcomes (v1, 6–8 weeks)
- **TTV < 10 min** from doc upload to first successful API call (sandbox).
- **SDK codegen determinism ≥ 98%** on golden suites.
- **Export repo** including: TypeScript SDK, NestJS server adapter, sample workflow, contract tests, mock server, Prom metrics, Helm chart.
- **Cited provenance** for any inferred spec fields (auth/rate limits) from docs (RAG).
- **Guardrails**: export blocked until auth, retry, and error mapping are set.

## 2) Scope (v1)
- Ingest: OpenAPI 3.0/3.1, Postman collection, GraphQL SDL, and Markdown/HTML (RAG fill-gaps).
- Codegen: TS SDK + Node/NestJS server; Python SDK optional (preview).
- Workflows: webhook/cron triggers, transform, call endpoint, store (stub), notify; retries + idempotency + DLQ.
- Testing: mock server + contract tests; Postman export.
- Ops: Prom metrics, simple Grafana dashboard JSON; runbooks for 429/token refresh.
- Export: repo ZIP + JSON bundle (spec/endpoints/models/flows).

**Out of scope (v1):** OAuth apps creation flows, AsyncAPI streaming runtimes, enterprise SSO/SCIM, multi-region HA for the generated server.

## 3) Target Users & Primary Jobs
- **Backend/platform engineers**: produce reliable integrations fast.
- **Solutions/RevOps**: build safe workflow automations.
- **Product teams**: prototype partner integrations.

## 4) Milestones & Timeline
- **M0 (Week 0–1): Foundations**
  - Repo, CI, IaC bootstrap; Postgres+pgvector; NATS; S3; basic auth/session.
  - Skeleton Next.js app with Designer/Flows/Codegen pages.
- **M1 (Week 2): Spec normalize + model explorer**
  - Parse OpenAPI/Postman/SDL; normalized spec persisted; endpoint/model trees.
  - RAG “infer gaps” (auth, pagination, rate limits) with provenance.
- **M2 (Week 3): TS SDK & server adapter**
  - Deterministic codegen; retries/backoff; error taxonomy; pagination helpers.
  - NestJS server starter + .env templates, request logging, tracing.
- **M3 (Week 4): Workflow builder (MVP)**
  - DAG JSON + runtime stubs (Temporal/BullMQ abstraction), idempotency + retries + DLQ.
  - Field mapping (Zod) and transform step.
- **M4 (Week 5): Tests + mocks + monitors**
  - Prism/httptest mock server; contract tests; Postman export; Prom metrics + dashboard JSON.
- **M5 (Week 6): Export & polish**
  - Repo bundler; Helm chart; README; sample flow; guardrails; problem+JSON surfaces.
- **Launch (Week 7–8):** Golden suite hardening, docs, demo flows, perf passes.

## 5) Workstreams
- **Spec/Docs & RAG:** parsers, inference with citations, score confidence.
- **Codegen:** SDK templates (TS first), server adapter, error/pagination/auth patterns.
- **Workflows:** DAG schema, idempotency keys, retries, DLQ, compensation hooks.
- **Testing & Mocks:** contract tests, fixtures, mock server, schema-drift alerts.
- **Ops & Monitors:** OTel, Prom metrics, SLO builder, Grafana json.
- **Export & DX:** repo zipper, presets, README skin, examples.
- **Frontend UX:** SpecViewer, FlowBuilder, DiffPane, OpsScaffold, ExportWizard.
- **Security/Compliance:** secret handling, license/SBOM, PII masking in logs.
- **DevEx/CI:** golden fixtures, deterministic builds, canary codegen snapshot tests.

## 6) KPIs & SLOs
- Spec normalize (200 endpoints) **< 20 s p95**; SDK codegen **< 15 s p95**; repo export **< 10 s p95**.
- Contract test **≥ 85% first-run pass** on golden APIs.
- User satisfaction **≥ 4.5/5** after first export.

## 7) Risks & Mitigations
- **Inconsistent docs** → RAG hallucination risk: require citations; show confidence; block export on low confidence for critical fields.
- **Codegen drift** → golden tests; snapshot diffs per template.
- **Schema drift at runtime** → contract test step + warning gates.
- **Auth gotchas** (OAuth/HMAC) → template checklists, sample envs, redaction tests.

## 8) Launch Checklist
- Golden suites (Stripe-like & Salesforce-like) green.
- Security review, SBOM, dependency scan.
- Docs & demo: "Lead Sync" flow, Postman, Grafana board.
- Onboarding tour + example repo preset.

## 9) Phase 3 Completion Summary (✅ DONE)
**Live Sandbox & Partner Sharing** - Enhanced flow execution and secure spec sharing capabilities:

### Flow Runner Enhancements:
- **Live execution mode** with real external API calls vs sandbox simulation
- **Temporal Cloud integration** with workflow orchestration, retry policies, and activity execution
- **Enhanced node types**: webhook, schedule, improved HTTP calls with headers/body
- **Retry policies** with exponential backoff and jitter for robust execution
- **Comprehensive logging** and execution analytics

### Partner Share System:
- **Secure share tokens** with granular permissions (download, copy, print)
- **Analytics tracking** with view counts and IP hashing for privacy
- **Expiration management** with time-based access control
- **Read-only spec viewer** with watermarking and access restrictions
- **Public share URLs** with SEO-optimized metadata and security headers
- **Sanitized spec sharing** removing internal/sensitive information

### API Endpoints Added:
- `POST /flows/run-live` - Execute flows with real external calls
- `POST /flows/run-temporal` - Execute flows via Temporal Cloud
- `POST /share` - Create secure partner share links
- `GET /share/token/:token` - Access shared specs via public URLs
- `GET /share/list` - List user's created shares
- `DELETE /share/:id` - Deactivate share links

### UI Components:
- **ReadOnlySpecViewer** - Partner-facing spec viewer with permission controls
- **Public share page** - SEO-optimized public access with security headers
- **Watermarking support** - Visual protection for sensitive specifications

**Status**: Phase 3 complete. All major features implemented with security best practices.

## 10) Bugs & Known Unknowns Resolution (✅ DONE)
**Advanced Pattern Support & Performance Optimization** - Resolved complex edge cases and performance bottlenecks:

### Non-Standard Pagination Patterns:
- **Compound cursor support** (Stripe-style starting_after + timestamp combinations)
- **Token-based pagination** (Google APIs pageToken patterns)
- **Timestamp-based pagination** (since/until patterns)
- **Hybrid pagination** (bookmark, continuation, scroll_id patterns)
- **Pattern detection** with confidence scoring and automatic helper generation
- **Multi-language support** for TypeScript, Python, and Go pagination helpers

### Advanced Authentication Combinations:
- **HMAC + OAuth hybrid auth** with AWS Signature v4 + OAuth token support
- **Shopify-style auth** combining access tokens with webhook HMAC validation
- **Custom auth pattern detection** from OpenAPI specs
- **Multi-step authentication flows** with sequential and parallel execution
- **Signature validation** with proper nonce handling and replay protection
- **Cross-platform crypto support** (browser SubtleCrypto + Node.js crypto)

### Large Spec Performance Optimization:
- **Spec complexity analysis** with automatic optimization strategy selection
- **Chunked processing** for specs with 1k+ endpoints (100 endpoints per chunk)
- **Streaming processing** for memory-efficient handling of XL specs
- **Parallel processing** with configurable concurrency limits
- **Memory optimizations**: lazy loading, response streaming, caching with TTL
- **Compression techniques**: example removal, description truncation, schema deduplication
- **Performance monitoring** with detailed metrics and processing time tracking

### Generated Optimizations:
- **Language-specific performance helpers** with batch processing and caching
- **Memory-efficient streaming** for large response handling
- **Lazy loading utilities** for expensive operations
- **Chunked request processing** to prevent memory overflow
- **Automatic batch size calculation** based on spec complexity

**Status**: All bugs and known unknowns resolved. System now handles edge cases and scales to enterprise-level API specifications.
